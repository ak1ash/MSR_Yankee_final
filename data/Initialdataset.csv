<p>We're still running Java 8.  I'm reading through <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html#BGBCIEFC"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/java.html#BGBCIEFC</a> , and I find the following statement:</p>

<p>So, I went into a container running a Java process.  I looked at /tmp, and I saw that it was writable.  I looked at the command line of the Java process, verifying that it doesn't set the ErrorFile location.  I checked the &quot;ps&quot; output to get the pid.  I executed &quot;kill -11 &quot;.  I then checked the &quot;ps&quot; output again, and I saw that a new Java process was running.  I then checked &quot;/tmp&quot; for a &quot;hs_err_pid&quot; file.  It was not there.</p>
<p>Is there something I'm missing here, or is this documentation not correct?</p>

"69083253","1","","","2021-09-07 06:23:49","","0","124","<p>I'm reading a book &quot;Thinking in Java&quot; that states the following about inner classes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each inner class can independently inherit from an implementation. So one way to look at the inner class is as the rest of the solution of the multiple-inheritance problem. Interfaces solve part of the problem, but inner classes effectively allow &quot;multiple <strong>implementation</strong> inheritance&quot;. That is, inner classes effectively allow you to inherit from more than one non-interface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've never used inner classes like that. So I started to thinking about how this could look and where this can be useful. I came up with this:</p>
<pre><code>public class ReadWriteCollection {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var rw = new ReadWriteCollection();
        var ro =  rw.new ReadPart();
        var ao =  rw.new AddPart();

        ao.add(&quot;foo&quot;);
        System.out.println(ro.read(0));
    }

    private List&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

    class AddPart extends AddOnlyCollection {
        void add(String s) { list.add(s); }
    }

    class ReadPart extends ReadOnlyCollection {
        String read(int index) { return list.get(index); }
    }

    public abstract static class ReadOnlyCollection {
        final void someExistingImplementation(){  System.out.println(&quot;Foo&quot;); }
        abstract String read(int index);

    }

    public abstract static class AddOnlyCollection {
        final void someExistingImplementation(){  System.out.println(&quot;Bar&quot;); }
        abstract void add(String s);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>ReadOnlyCollection</code> and <code>AddOnlyCollection</code> represent some existing implementations that I can't control. I've put them inside <code>ReadWriteCollection</code> just for convenience in my example.</p>
<p>So is it how inner classes should be used for &quot;multiple implementation inheritance&quot;? Can somebody give more examples and possible usages for this technique? Or is it the way inner classes were used in the past and no longer used like this (the book is quite old)?</p>

<p>The issue occurs in the constructor of <code>CommunicationOption</code>. I attempt to add the recently constructed object into the <code>instances</code>, however, <code>instances</code> hasn't been instantiated by Java, so a NullPointerExecption shows up.</p>
<p>I've tried to edit the constructor to catch this bug, like so:</p>
<pre><code>private static ArrayList&lt;Option&gt; instances = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(4);

CommunicationOption(int id, String label) {
    super(id, label);
            
    if ( instances == null ) {
        instances = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
    }
    instances.add(this);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The execption no longer throws, however, <code>instances</code> gets instantiated again and ends up pointing to a different place in memory when <code>prompt()</code> gets called. If I make <code>instances</code> null, <code>instances</code> ends up being null when <code>prompt()</code> is run.</p>
<p>Ideally, it would be great if I could tell Java to instance a field immediately at runtime, however, I don't know how to do that.</p>

I have a file, in the network and I want to create an Itext image with it and for that, I have to convert its path to URL. The problem is when I use <code>path.toURI().toURL()</code> it appends my project path to the URL such that my URL ends up starting with C:/ which will not work.
Is there a way to just convert a string to file URL in java?
I have tried this:</p>
<pre><code>        String paths = &quot;‪\\\\DESKTOP-A11F076\\Users\\Benson Korir\\Desktop\\walgotech\\passport.jpg&quot;;

The messages come in a stream of bytes and are identified by the first 2 bytes (opcode).
So I have this interface</p>
<pre><code>public interface Message&lt;T&gt; extends Encodeable {

    Message&lt;T&gt; act(T actOn, UserCommandInvocationProtocol&lt;T&gt; protocol);

    byte[] encode();  // from Encodeable

}
</code></pre>
<p>The server should create a Message according to the opcode in the stream.
my current solution is hashmap that maps each opcode to a matching lambda, for example:</p>
<pre><code>    addMessageDecoder(3, nextByte -&gt; {
        String[] strArr = strPtrnDec2.decodeNextByte(nextByte);
        return strArr != null ? new LoginMessage(strArr[0], strArr[1]) : null;  // LoginMessage implements Message
    });
</code></pre>
<p>the interface used for the lambdas:</p>
<pre><code> interface MessageDecoder&lt;T&gt; {

    Message&lt;T&gt; decodeNextByte(byte nextByte);

}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how I have <code>encode()</code> in the <code>Message</code> interface, so each message can turn to bytes.
What I would have liked to have is <code>static decode()</code> for each message that creates a matching Message object, If Java had allowed it, it would have looked something like this:</p>
<pre><code>public interface Message&lt;T&gt; extends Encodeable {

    Message&lt;T&gt; act(T actOn, UserCommandInvocationProtocol&lt;T&gt; protocol);

    byte[] encode();

    static Message&lt;T&gt; decodeNextByte(byte nextByte):  // does the job of interface MessageDecoder&lt;T&gt;

}

<p>What would be the best practice here? or maybe my current solution is fine?

<p>I'm writing some code for an imaginary bank, and I want to include all the accounts' balance into one if statement. I made a double called <code>accountBalance</code> that I use for each account.
For example, <code>Josie.accountBalance = 1200</code>. <code>Josie</code> is an object for the <code>BankAccounts</code> type I created.</p>
<p>I want to make an if statement, so that if the account balance is above 1000, the bank sends a message warning the account about this issue, and it refunds everything above 1000$.</p>
<p>I could just do an if statement for every account I create, and write my code there, but I was wondering if there was a way to write an if statement that applied to all the <code>BankAccounts</code> type, without having to specify the names.</p>

"65546563","1","","","2021-01-03 04:13:44","","0","475","<p>Here is a question which tells that boxTypes[0] contains number of boxes and boxTypes[1] tells how many units are there in each boxtype. trucksize tells how many boxes a truck can hold. We have to find maximum number of units a truck can hold.
My approach is to use greedy solution by sorting w.r.t number of units in each box and then subtract the trucksize with number of boxes.
The code snippet is like this</p>
<pre><code>public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
       int c = 0;
       TreeMap&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();
       for(int[] i : boxTypes){
           m.put(i[1], i[0]);
       }
       for(Map.Entry&lt;Integer, Integer&gt; i : m.entrySet()){
           if(truckSize - i.getValue() &gt; 0){
               c += i.getValue() * i.getKey();
               truckSize -= i.getValue();
           } else if(truckSize - i.getValue() == 0){
               c += i.getValue() * i.getKey();
               truckSize -= i.getValue();
               break;
           } else if(truckSize - i.getValue() &lt; 0){
               c += (i.getValue() - truckSize) * i.getKey();
               break;
           }
       }
       return c;
   }
</code></pre>
<p>The input and output as as follows.
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: There are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 box of the first type that contains 3 units.</li>
<li>2 boxes of the second type that contain 2 units each.</li>
<li>3 boxes of the third type that contain 1 unit each.
You can take all the boxes of the first and second types, and one box of the third type.
The total number of units will be = (1 * 3) + (2 * 2) + (1 * 1) = 8.</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't understand why the code doesn't work, please help if I have missed some logic.</p>

<p>Alternative that comes to my mind would be to first replace all <code>\;</code> with a Very specific substring (e.g. &quot;%%€€&quot;, then split into a list by <code>;</code> and re-substitute the escaped ones with <code>;</code>. There is a tiny risk that this causes issues.</p>

Here is the assessment:
&quot;You are given a sequence of characters consisting of parentheses <strong>( )</strong> and brackets <strong>[ ]</strong>.</p>
<p>A String of this type is said to be correct:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it is an <strong>empty</strong> or <strong>null</strong> string</li>
<li>if the string <strong>A</strong> is correct ,<strong>(A)</strong> and <strong>[A]</strong> are correct</li>
<li>if the string <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> are correct the concatenation <strong>AB</strong> is also
correct</li>
</ul>
<p>input: The string contains at most 10000 characters.</p>
<p>Examples:<strong>[( )]</strong> is correct ,<strong>(( )[ ])</strong> is correct,<strong>( [ ) ]</strong> is not correct,<strong>((</strong> is not correct.</p>
<p>Implement the method <em><strong>check(String str)</strong></em> to check the correctness of a string of this type.
<em><strong>check</strong></em> returns <strong>true</strong> if the string is correct,<strong>false</strong> otherwise. &quot;</p>
<p>So i did that code below:</p>
<pre><code>public class Solution {
    
    public static boolean check(String str) {
         String str1 = null,str2 = null;
         if(str==null|| str.length()==0) return true;
         if (check(str1)==true &amp;&amp; check(str2)==true) {
             return true;
         }
        return false;
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        System.out.println(Solution.check(&quot;([])&quot;));    //true
        System.out.println(Solution.check(&quot;()[]&quot;));    //true
        System.out.println(Solution.check(&quot;([)]&quot;));    //false
        System.out.println(Solution.check(&quot;((&quot;));      //false
        System.out.println(Solution.check(&quot;[(()])&quot;));   //false

    }

}
</code></pre>
<p>But i run it and i get:</p>
<pre><code>true
true
true
true
true

<p>How can i fix it?</p>

<ol>
<li>Produce a .jar file</li>
<li>Create a JRE folder (which I can do by just copying the
contents of my local java jre folder)</li>
<li>Use Launch4J to create an .exe file that uses the JRE folder</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting .exe file should be executable for everyone as long as the JRE folder is at the path specified in Launch4J.</p>
<p>I did the above and when I try to run the .exe, I get <code>a jni error has occurred please check your installation and try again</code>. I did some googleing and found out that this error is most likely caused by an incompatible JRE version / the JRE in the JRE folder being different from what was used to compile the .jar</p>
<p>While developing and also when creating the .jar, I used a JDK - so I tried filling the JRE folder with a JDK instead and then I could run the .exe without a problem.</p>
<p><strong>So now to the actual question:</strong></p>
<p>Does this mean I need to create the .jar file somehow using the JRE instead of the JDK (I always assumed while developing I must use the JDK, since its the java DEVELOPMENT kid) ? If yes, how do I configure that in IntelliJ?</p>

<p>This method takes the console input as a string, then it checks, how many numbers(strings) does it contain, are there any negative numbers and so on. But it can be applied only for substrings(words without whitespace). In my case it can be applied to arr[i].</p>
<p>So I modified it to split String into array[] and tried to check every single element. I've got:</p>
<pre><code>public static boolean isDigit (String input, int n){

<p><strong>SOLVED</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks to everybody, your help was really usefull. I finally found the problem</strong>
It was in isDigit() method. It was checking out every element of array, and switched a flag according to the last result. I wrote &quot;break&quot; to stop the further checking if there was at least one false flag in loop.</p>
<pre><code>public static boolean isDigit (String input, int n){
        String[] arr = input.split(&quot;\\s+&quot;);
        boolean flag = false;
        if (arr.length != n){
            flag = false;
        }
        else{
            for (String s: arr){
                if (s.startsWith(&quot;-&quot;)) {
                    if (s.substring(1).matches(&quot;[0-9]*&quot;)){
                        flag = true;
                    }
                    else {
                        flag = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }

<p>For the first invocation, the key = 15 and the 3×3 matrix does NOT contain that key, hence the output should be not found.  In the second invocation,key=71 in the 4×4 matrix, and it does contain the key, so the output should be(1,3)).</p>

<p>It stops printing after it tells the user how much they owe. Does anyone know what to do? And it also stops working with the amount of change it is suppose to give back. I guess it isn't finding the variables, but I'm very confused on how to fix this. I think I might need to do something with the variables in the beginning to make them more clear but I'm not sure.</p>

Now for this course, I've got a book with theory and exercises. Now I'm stuck at a certain exercise but the book doesn't provided theory or answers to this exercise.</p>
<p>So I've got this Class file (<code>DateFirstTry.java</code>) and a Main file, which runs the program.</p>
<pre><code>public class DateFirstTry {

    public String month;
    public int day;
    public int year;
    
    public void writeOutput()
    {
        System.out.println(month + &quot; &quot; + day + &quot;, &quot; + year);
    }
    
    public void makeItNewYears()
    {
        month = &quot;January&quot;;
        day = 1;
    }
   
    public void yellIfNewYears()
    {
        if ( (month.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;January&quot;) ) &amp;&amp; (day == 1) ) 
            System.out.println(&quot;Hurrah!&quot;);
        else 
            System.out.println(&quot;Not New Year's Day.&quot;);
    }
}

</code></pre>
<pre><code>public class DateFirstTryDemo {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        DateFirstTry date1, date2;
        date1 = new DateFirstTry();
        date2 = new DateFirstTry();
        date1.month = &quot;December&quot;;
        date1.day = 31;
        date1.year = 2012;
        System.out.println(&quot;date1:&quot;);
        date1.writeOutput();
    
        date2.month = &quot;July&quot;;
        date2.day = 4;
        date2.year = 1776;
        System.out.println(&quot;date2:&quot;);
        date2.writeOutput();
    
        DateFirstTry makeItNewYears;
    
        DateFirstTry yellIfNewYears;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So, they explained how I should create the <code>makeItNewYears</code> and <code>yellIfNewYears</code> methods, but don't explain how to call them in the main code. I've tried somethings and <code>DateFirstTry makeItNewYears;</code> is the only thing that doesn't give an error, but also doesn't give any output.</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me with this!</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public class SubClass {
    @Override
    public Object foo(Object obj) {
        final Object swappedObj = beforeExecution(obj);

        // Notice that original code now consumes swapped param
        final Object returnValue = _foo_original_code(swappedObj);

        return afterExecution(returnValue);
    }

    private Object _foo_original_code(final Object obj) {
        return &quot;bar&quot; + obj.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>How can I achieve this easily?</strong></p>
<p>I'm looking for options other than using Template Method design pattern. I know Spring Framework supports AOP but I wanted to know if there are other (easier) ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>I know that I could create first a List&lt;String&gt; and then create the linked list passing to the firs list to constructor. e.g</p>
<pre><code>List&lt;String&gt; cities=  Arrays.asList(&quot;NY&quot;,&quot;LA&quot;,&quot;Seattle&quot;,&quot;San francisco&quot;);
LinkedList&lt;String&gt; linkedCities = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;(cities);

<p>Example:
a.jar has one class, with the static void main() method, that just prints &quot;world&quot;</p>
<p>My goal is it to load a.jar's main class, get the static void main() method, and add another call to print &quot;hello&quot; at the top, then save it to disk again. So now if i run a.jar, it says &quot;world&quot;, then I run my program, it saves the jarfile, then I run a.jar again and it says &quot;hello&quot;, then &quot;world&quot;.</p>

<p>So my main code for the part of the problem I am facing with is the following:</p>
<pre><code>    public CardSet(int howMany){
        PlayingCard = new PlayingCard[howMany];
        startCount = howMany;
        Random rand = new Random();
        int count;
        for(count = 0; count &lt; PlayingCard.length; count++){
            int x = rand.nextInt(13) + 1;
            int y = rand.nextInt(4) + 0;
            PlayingCard[count] = new PlayingCard(y, x);
            PlayingCard pc = new PlayingCard();

        }
    }

    public void printSet(){
        System.out.println(&quot;\t-------------------------&quot;);
        for(int i = 0; i &lt; PlayingCard.length; i++) {
            System.out.println(PlayingCard[i]);
        }
    }

<p>Here is the full code of the program, CardSet.java is where I updated the code.</p>

<p>Is there efficient way to sort the linked list without Collections, and using only the methods in the class LinkedList ? (without creating new arrays or new Links)</p>
<p>What I tried to do is using while and for loops with the functions &quot;get(int index)&quot; and &quot;set(int index)&quot;</p>
<p>But Im looking for more efficient way.</p>

<p>I thought <code>Collection.sort()</code> would sort accending. I thought <code>a.length()</code> is 4 and <code>b.length()</code> is 3 which would evaluate as <code>(4 &gt;= 3)</code> true. So <code>a.length() &gt;= b.length() ? 1 : 0</code> would return 1 and mean that <code>&quot;test&quot;</code> is greater than <code>&quot;abc&quot;</code>. So it should be sorted like <code>[abc, test]</code>.</p>
<p>But I only get the result <code>[abc, test]</code> when I change the code to <code>a.length() &gt;= b.length() ? 1 : -1</code>, which seems to indicate that <code>a.length() &gt;= b.length()</code>evaluates as <code>false</code>. Why is that?</p>
<p>Why does the first lambda expression lead to <code>[test, abc]</code>, while the modified version leads to <code>[abc, test]</code>?</p>
<p><code>Collections.sort(list, (a, b) -&gt; a.compareTo(b));</code> works like expected.</p>

<p>I implemented 2 calendars in html, for filtering the data between 2 dates. When i filter data for the first time, i will select both calendar dates and the data is filtering. Now we have both the inputs for calendar given right. Now my issue lies here. When i change the first calendar date. the second calendar remains the same with previously assigned date as we filtered previously. and there is no change in the filtering of data until we give inputs to both calendars again. I want the second calendar value to be cleared on changing the first calendar. And also clear the first calendar input when the second calendar is changed. Please help me achieve this.</p>
<p>can we trigger the output based on either of the input values ? as of now it's not showing. example: i have 2 records in grid: with dates : 07/12/2020 and 15/12/2020 Initially if i filter from dec 1st 2020 to dec 31st 2020. It's showing both records. Now, again if i set 15/12/2020 in first calendar without changing second. There is no change in the table. i should enter second also. Can we fix it ??</p>

Unfortunately, when I asked for clarification it created more questions, so I'm hoping I'm just missing something simple here and I'm overthinking the issue. Here is the assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Create a class named Purchase.  Each Purchase contains an invoice
number, amount of sale, and amount of sales tax.  Include set methods
for the invoice number and sale amount.  Within the set() method for
the sale amount, calculate the sales tax as 7.5% (using a static field
in the Purchase class) of the sale amount.  Also include a display
method that displays a purchase's details in a well formatted output
display.</p>
<p>Save the file as Purchase.java. Compile and run the program
until it works and the output looks nice, add the necessary
documentation as described in Course Documents, and then attach your
.java file to this assignment. Do not attach the .class file, attach
only your source code. This assignment is due the last day of the
academic week.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I created the Purchase class with all of the required set methods and display methods, but in the past when we've been required to create a class like this we've also been required to create and provide a test class. When I asked if we needed to submit our test class, the instructor said, &quot;you do not need a separate class, however you still must include test code.&quot;</p>
<p>My question is it seems like the assignment was specifically asking for a unique class for creating Purchase objects, not an application. How can I provide test code without another class? I've asked for clarification, but I'm not sure if he'll get back to me before it's due.</p>

<p>What I get from this is:

<p>I am trying to update the individual maps by getting a value and using it to update only the values for a single map in the map of maps:</p>

<p>So what I am hoping for is this:
[cache1:[hits:6, entries:3, misses:5], cache2:[hits:5, entries:1, misses:1], cache3:[hits:22, entries:5, misses:11]]</p>
<p>I am calling the method to update my maps like this:</p>

    pollingVerifier.verify({
        assert validateCacheMisses(cacheStatisticsName) &gt; cacheStatistics.get(cacheStatisticsTrackerName).get(&quot;misses&quot;)
    }, CACHE_STATISTICS_RETRIES)

    pollingVerifier.verify({
        assert validateCacheEntries(cacheStatisticsName) &gt; cacheStatistics.get(cacheStatisticsTrackerName).get(&quot;entries&quot;)
    }, CACHE_STATISTICS_RETRIES)

    trackCacheStatistics(cacheStatisticsName, cacheStatisticsTrackerName, cacheStatistics)
}
</code></pre>
<p>So what I want is to see 1 map get updated, but what I am seeing is all maps get updated with the same values, like this:</p>
<p>[cache1:[hits:22, entries:1, misses:1], cache2:[hits:22, entries:1, misses:1], cache3:[hits:22, entries:1, misses:1]]</p>
<p>I call that method like this:</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
<p>You are developing a File Manager but encountered a problem. You realised that two files cannot have the same names and if a conflict arises, the file which came later has to be appended with a number <code>N</code> such that <code>N</code> is the smallest positive number that is not used with that particular file name. The number is append in the form of <code>file_name(N)</code>. Write a code to solve your problem. You will be given an array of strings of file names. You need to assume that if a file name appears earlier in an array, it was created first.
<strong>NOTE:</strong> <code>file_name</code> and <code>file_name(2)</code> are two different file names i.e if a file name already has a number appended to it, its a different file name.</p>
<p><strong>Input</strong>
The first line contains <code>N</code>, the number of strings.
The next line contains <code>N</code> space-separated strings (file names).</p>
<p><strong>Output</strong>
Print the names of files, after making the necessary changes separated by space.</p>
<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 ≤ N ≤ 50
1 ≤ file_name.length ≤ 25
filename has no white space characters</p>

<p>Question: How do you add the data (characters or int) to the output stream that is passed to you? I pass all of the tests except the output stream ones and since the Kata specified that OutputStream is OPTIONAL I am getting very frustrated. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I do have it adding interest correctly in my SavingsAccountClass. My withdraw method in the SpecialSavings class does not seem to work either. Any assistance would be greatly appreaciated. Below is the outline of what I am try to accomplish:</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong><br />
Create a class SavingsAccount. Use a static class variable to store the annualInterestRate for each of the savers. Each object of the class contains a private instance variable savingsBalance indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit. Provide method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying the balance by annualInterestRate divided by 12; this interest should be added to savingsBalance. Provide a static method modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value. Write a driver program to test the class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two different savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the new balances for each of the savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5% and calculate the next months interest and print the new balances for each of the savers.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong><br />
Write another class SpecialSavings that extends SavingsAccount to pay interest of 10% on accounts that have balances that exceed 10K. Also provided methods to deposit and take money out of savings account. Write a driver program to test the class SpecialSavings. Instantiate two different savingsAccount objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. Make a few deposits and withdrawals and show balance and interest earned for each account.</p>

<p>Basically, I'm trying to print the sum of 2 numbers provided by the user. We want to take input and print numbers in this sample format:</p>
<pre><code>Input
3 
1 2
100 200
10 40

Output
3
300
50
</code></pre>
<p>We'll first ask the user to enter the number of test cases. In the above sample, it's 3. Then in the next lines, the user will enter numbers as shown, and then the out would be shown as shown in the sample.
In the above-mentioned incomplete code, I've declared an array to store the numbers entered by the user. in my code, each time the inner loop gets executed the values in the index variables are rewritten. I want my program to store values in different index numbers. for example, if the user enters the value of test cases as 3 then my code should store 6 values (taken from the user) in 6 index variables in the array.</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Da li imate promo kod? (yes / no ): &quot;);
    if (yesNo.contains(&quot;yes&quot;)) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Unesite vas promo kod: &quot;);
        String promoCode = scanner.nextLine();
        for (Flights flight : flights) {
            if (promoCode.equals(flight.getPromoCode())) {
                System.out.println(&quot;Ostvarili ste popust od 10%&quot;);
            } else {
                System.out.println(&quot;Vas promo kod nije validan.&quot;);
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Also now I deleted this part of code:</p>
<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;Da li imate promo kod? (yes / no ): &quot;);
    if (yesNo.contains(&quot;yes&quot;)) {
        System.out.println(&quot;Unesite vas promo kod: &quot;);
        String promoCode = scanner.nextLine();
        for (Flights flight : flights) {
            if (promoCode.equals(flight.getPromoCode())) {
                System.out.println(&quot;Ostvarili ste popust od 10%&quot;);
            } else {
                System.out.println(&quot;Vas promo kod nije validan.&quot;);
            }
        }
</code></pre>
<p>that is, code that does not work when I run the program and added this just for debugging:</p>
<pre><code>String yesNo = scanner.nextLine();

if(yesNo.contains(&quot;s&quot;)){
        System.out.println(&quot;aaa&quot;);
    }else{
        System.out.println(&quot;eee&quot;);
    }
</code></pre>
<p>and the program prints me &quot;eee&quot; right away. it does not give me the option to enter a word even though it is in the code to enter</p>
<p>Also when i comment first part of code, this:</p>
<pre><code>/*  System.out.println(&quot;Upisite ID leta kako biste ga rezervisali!&quot;);

    int userChoice = scanner.nextInt();

    for (Flights flight : flights) {
        if (userChoice == flight.getFlightId())
            System.out.println(&quot;Rezervisali ste let za: &quot; + flight.getTo()
                    + &quot; od &quot; + flight.getFrom() + &quot;. Cena za biznis klasu je: &quot; + flight.getBusinessClassPrice() + &quot;$&quot;);
    }*/
</code></pre>
<p>Second part works fine, so idk really now</p>
<p>Okey I notice one more thing,</p>
<p>On this part of code:</p>
<pre><code> for (Flights flight : flights) {
        if (userChoice == flight.getFlightId())
            System.out.println(&quot;Rezervisali ste let za: &quot; + flight.getTo()
                    + &quot; od &quot; + flight.getFrom() + &quot;. Cena za biznis klasu je: &quot; + flight.getBusinessClassPrice() + &quot;$&quot;);
    } //If a delete this curly brace, second part of code works, just print each souts four time because I have 4 flights and etc.

<p>How to do this in java? I <code>List.sort()</code> or <code>Array.sort()</code> cannot be used for this as it can sort the entire as ascending or descending only. Can someone suggest the best way to achieve this?</p>

<p>I am learning java from MOOC fi. I am currently in week 5 and it mentions here that to compare two objects, you have to do the following:</p>
<pre><code>public class SimpleDate {
    private int day;
    private int month;
    private int year;

    public SimpleDate(int day, int month, int year) {
        this.day = day;
        this.month = month;
        this.year = year;
    }

    public boolean equals(Object compared) {
        // if the variables are located in the same position, they are equal
        if (this == compared) {
            return true;
        }

        // if the type of the compared object is not SimpleDate, the objects are not equal
        if (!(compared instanceof SimpleDate)) {
            return false;
        }

        // convert the Object type compared object
        // into a SimpleDate type object called comparedSimpleDate
        SimpleDate comparedSimpleDate = (SimpleDate) compared;

        // if the values of the object variables are the same, the objects are equal
        if (this.day == comparedSimpleDate.day &amp;&amp;
            this.month == comparedSimpleDate.month &amp;&amp;
            this.year == comparedSimpleDate.year) {
            return true;
        }

        // otherwise the objects are not equal
        return false;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return this.day + &quot;.&quot; + this.month + &quot;.&quot; + this.year;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>So I am confused, what does:</p>
<pre><code>public boolean equals(Object compared) {
    // if the variables are located in the same position, they are equal
    if (this == compared) {
        return true;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>the above code actually do? What does located in same position mean?</p>
<p>Isn't it better to just check if an object is of a particular class type and then compare their instance variables to see if they are equal?</p>

<p>I feel like there should be a relatively easy way to take what is passed into the API, convert it to uppercase, compare it to the enum, and if it matches, store/return the enum.

<p>Some guys in this community of men have a father-son relationship. My question is that:<br />
I'm looking for a neater way to build this father-son relationship.</p>
<p>I tried to establish this relationship with integers (example: which_father shows the directory where the man's father is in the 'mans' list) but this has some disadvantages:<br />
1-When creating objects, I always have to create sons after fathers. because:</p>
<pre><code>private void createMan() {
    Man man = new Man(&quot;Ethan&quot;);
    man.index_father = 4;
    mans.add(man);
    mans.get(4).index_son = mans.indexOf(man);
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we haven't created the father yet, the 4th element of mans will not have been created yet.<br />
2- In cases where I delete an element from the mans arraylist, which_fathers will not show the correct father man.</p>
<p>I may not know enough about Java, but there must be an easy way to establish a connection between objects (like the father-son relationship in this example), right?</p>

    }
</code></pre>
<p>This is main code:</p>
<pre><code>if (userPromoCode.contains(tempFlights.getPromoCode())) {
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Error is:</strong></p>
<p>The promo code from the first object is valid over each object, so if the user enters the promo code of the first object he has a discount on each flight.</p>
<p><strong>What I need:</strong></p>
<p>User choose one flight by ID, that flight has some promo code, if the user enters that promo code they get a discount.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>User pick ID number 3, that is this flight:
<code>Flight flight3 = new Flight(3, &quot;Podgorica&quot;, &quot;Nis&quot;, 25, 40, 80, &quot;sx33&quot;);</code>
When a program asks a user for a promo code, he should enter <code>sx33</code> for discount, otherwise message is <code>no discount for you</code> for example.</p>
<p>I tried to loop like:</p>
<pre><code> for (int i = 0; i &lt; flightList.size();) {
            if (userPromoCode.contains(flightList.get(i).getPromoCode())) {
</code></pre>
<p>But its stil same.</p>

<p>And the error message is like following.<br>
'The method greatherThan(Object) in the type Comparable_ is not applicable for the arguments (Comparable_)'<br>
In my opinion, since obj2 is Comparable_ instance it is possible to pass obj2 to parameter,Object obj.<br>
Please let me know what is wrong here :)</p>

<p>What I want to do now is to first loop the person attribute and do some coding there, after, I would like to filter the rows with the same personID in the activities CSV and loop those rows with the same personID and do some coding there.</p>
<p>So the code I have for now is:</p>
<pre><code>BufferedReader attributeReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(attributesFile));
String agent = null;
while ((agent = attributeReader.readLine()) != null) {
    String[] attributeSpilted = agent.split(&quot;,&quot;);

    // Set attributes for agents
    Person person = populationFactory.createPerson(Id.createPersonId(attributeAgentID));

    // Question: What I should do here to find the activities with the same personID?

    population.addPerson(person);
}

<p>The question I have is in the code, I get stuck there and unsure about what I should do here to find the activities with the same personID?</p>

<p>I have two files &quot;birds.txt&quot; and &quot;birds2.txt&quot;. essentially I have the first part done where it will read &quot;birds.txt&quot; and sort them in a list by frequency of how many times a specific bird is seen which works fine (how many times the name of any given bird appears in the &quot;birds&quot;txt&quot;).</p>
<p>The part I can't seem to wrap my head around is how I would take my existing list and compare it to my second file &quot;birds2.txt&quot; and then have it remove any duplicate entries. So the first and second file will have some of the same birds and if when reading the second file it finds a bird already in the list it removes it then prints this &quot;new&quot; list again.</p>

<p>here is the code I have written. What is the problem with the ActionListener it doesn't seem to work here</p>
<p>I here used JRadioButtons and created 3 of them red,blue,green. I placed them in a ButtonGroup. after this I added an actionListener associated with it. Then I created a JPanel and added a border to it. its name is colorBox. and then in the class changeListener i created an if and else statement, stating that if e.getSource or red(Button).isSelected() then the background of the colorBox panel will be set to red, and the same for the rest of the buttons i did the same but the color of that panel didn't change after I clicked the JRadioButton. <strong>What is the problem here? How can I correct this</strong></p>

 void increment ...

<p>then it would prevent the &quot;rude&quot;(the above) from happening. Could someone explains why it is &quot;rude&quot; to be able to modify the field like above? instead of just calling the method of the object using anotherCounter.increment() in this specific example.</p>
<p>Also when it says &quot;By making currentValue private to class BasicCounter, only the instance of BasicCounter itself can access the currentValue field. Now, this rudeness on the part of the calling
object would simply be impossible&quot;. So does it mean the following two lines of code here would not work? (or actually it still works?  I think it still works because we just make a new instance of the BasicCounter class right? so it is still working even if we declare &quot;currentValue&quot; private):</p>
<pre><code>BasicCounter anotherCounter = new BasicCounter();
anotherCounter.currentValue = anotherCounter.currentValue + 1;

<p>So these two lines of code still work even if the variable &quot;currentValue&quot; is declared private, right?

<p>It is not the complete program but I got this error too many times while implementing Stack Interface and ArrayList Interface. That's why I'm asking.</p>

<p>I tried to summarize my problem with these lines of code.<br />
My problem is:<br />
I don't know if it is related to the primitiveness of the txt file but I have 2 problems.</p>
<ol>
<li>e.g. I always need to initialize son objects after their father. Otherwise &quot;persons.get(which_father);&quot; It will return IndexOutOfBoundsException error.</li>
<li>For example, there are 10 people registered in my txt file. (0-9 index) Let the father of the person in 9.index be the person in index 3. When I delete the person in index 1 and delete and save the 1.index line from the txt file; now our man's father is in index 2, not index 3. Changing the number of the father from 3 to 2 is complicated.</li>
</ol>
<p>I feel unnecessarily complicated to operate on the txt file. How can I solve these 2 problems and code complexity?</p>

<p>The maximum exp a <strong>Exp Collector Pot</strong> can use is: <strong>10.000</strong></p>
<p>Each time a player is killing a monster and take an amount of experience, the number of the <strong>Exp Collector Pot</strong> he has on him are draining the experience and store it on them.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to do it's the following:</p>
<p>Let's say the player receive an amount of 5.000 experience and he has 3 <strong>Exp Collector Pot</strong>. The experience should be divined by <strong>3</strong> so each pot should store <strong>1666</strong> experience.</p>
<p>If a <strong>Exp Collector Pot</strong> reaches the maximum exp it can carry which is <strong>10.000</strong> then it self destroy but it don't drain the whole exp. If the <strong>Pot</strong> has let's say <strong>9.999</strong> experience stored then it will use only <strong>1</strong> of the <strong>1666</strong> that it deserve. Then the other POT will absorb more experience.</p>
<p>The problem is that i cannot think of the MATH to do this.
The class for the <strong>Pot</strong> is a simple record:</p>
<p><code>public static record ExperienceCollectorPot(int getId, long getExp) {}</code></p>
<p>So far I made the division of the total experience which is this:</p>
<p><code>final int maxExpPerCollector = Math.max(1, EXPERIENCE / COLLECTORS.size());</code></p>
<p>but then I simply don't know what I need to do to make the system work like I mentioned. I understand programming but I'm terrible at math and logical operations.</p>

Reading this link <a href=""https://beginnersbook.com/2013/05/inner-class/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> I understand the logistical differences (i.e. no name, only 1 instantiation, only accessible where defined, etc. But it's really not a class so why is it called a class? It's actually, from what I can see an instantiation of a class. I see you can have other methods as well from the class it is derived from, but how are you allowed to have completely different methods than the base class w/o having to use @Override?</p>

 * and checking if it is divisible by 3. If yes, generate a string from the array, 
 * convert it into an int and return the result.
 * 4. If the initial number is not divisible by 3, starting with the smallest number 
 * (right to left), so we are checking the largest number possible, we remove a digit until
 * we get to the first (largest) digit, checking if the sum of the remaining digits is 
 * divisible by 3. If so, the number is returned.

I was thinking about doing a combination of <code>split</code> (setting a limit and removing the final index), then <code>join</code> to recreate the string with <code>/</code> seperators, but wondering if there's a cleaner way ?</p>

<p>Its okay if the user date input has the same date given in the data set. However, odometer cannot be less than the previously recorded at 156572 on 2021-2-5. So its invalid.</p>
<p>Here is my test input validation algorithm so far:</p>
<pre><code>public static Date[] dates = new Date[3];

        dates[2] = new Date(2021,2,4);

        odometer[0] = 156830;
        odometer[1] = 156572;
        odometer[2] = 156255;
        
        //Inputs
        Date inputDate = new Date(2021,2,14);
        int inputOdo = 156255;
        
        if(!hasDuplicate(inputDate, inputOdo))//Checks for duplicate

<p>My actual result: I could not find the method.</p>

<p>Conside I have 2 models ItemDetails.java and ItemDetailsWithTimestamp.java
In one case i need to return the first model and in another case i want the second one:
I tried something like:</p>

public void getitemWithTimestampTest() {
    ItemApi itemApi = new ItemApi();
    ItemDetailsWithTimestamp result = itemApi.getitem(ItemDetailsWithTimestamp.class);
} 
</code></pre>
<p>And in the <strong><code>ItemApi</code></strong> class the method <code>getitem</code>:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public static &lt;T&gt; ResponseEntity&lt;T&gt; getitem(Class&lt;T&gt; type) {

<p><strong>I have some difficulties in understanding how a static field is changing!!!</strong></p>
<p>Given that I have <code>ODD_NUMBERS</code> as <code>static</code> list of <code>integer numbers</code> which is filled by the odd numbers. But then I send this list <em><strong>as a parameter</strong></em> to the <code>addEvenNumbers</code> method which adds some <code>Even integers</code> into it and the result of the print inside the method is:</p>
<pre><code>listOfNumbers: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

<p>But, when i back to the <code>main()</code> method and print the static variable <code>ODD_NUMBERS</code> then it has the same value as  also changed to the below values <code>listOfNumbers</code> like below :</p>
<pre><code> [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]
</code></pre>
<p>The fact that <code>listOfNumbers</code> and <code>ODD_NUMBERS</code> have identical values surprises me, because the value <code>listOfNumbers</code> is a parameter of <code>addEvenNumbers</code> and it must have no effect out of this block of code. Also, the method never returns anythings.</p>
<p>So, my question is:</p>
<p>Is it because the parameter of method (<code>listOfNumbers</code>) is referenced by an static parameter ?
Can you explain how the static variable changes ?</p>

Write a function:</p>

<p>that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B] that are divisible by K, i.e.:</p>
<p>{ i : A ≤ i ≤ B, i mod K = 0 }</p>
<p>For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3, because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.</p>
<p>Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:</p>
<p>A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
A ≤ B.</p>
<p>I am working on my own solution. I got 62% correct. However, there are some defects that I do not know how to implement it. Can anyone help me with this please?

            if(A == 0 || B == 0)

            count += 1;

        return count;
    }

<p>Issues 1 (Correctness tests)
In A = 10, B = 10, K in 5. I expected 1 since 10%5 = 0 but the answer is 0. Can anyone explain why is it 0 please?</p>
<p>Issue 2 (Correctness tests)
I got one incorrect while verify handling of range endpoints, multiple runs
May I know what is it exactly testing? It's not showing the test numbers in evaluation.</p>
<p>Issue 3 (Performance tests)
Another one incorrect happened while A = 101, B = 123M+, K = 10K. My answer got 12346 but expected 12345. What went wrong in this test case?</p>
<p>I really want to know if there's a way that I can implement this solution. Appreciate for helping!</p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this is because I want it to be compiled into 1 class file, so that I can run said class file and have it working on its own outside of my IDE. This was possible in unity using networking / web requests, so I assumed it would be something similar for java,  however its more popular to import something which appears to be using maven or gradle (I'm really not familiar with either so I don't know.) I wrote a simple script for unity in order to send the most basic text webhook, and thats it.</p>
<p>So if anyone knows how to use webhooks in one class please let me know!</p>

<p>First though was to loop over the list and</p>
<pre><code>public static void calculateAccountTotal(){
double total = 0;
        for (Customer c : CUSTOMERS) {
            for (Account a : c.getAccounts()) {
                total += a.getAccountBalance();
                a.setTotal(total);
            }
      }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This does not work as the previous total is added to the next customer.</p>
<p>A potential solution would be to add an accountKey to the Customer and Account, so I can have a constant in both lists, to check if they match and calculate the total.
Maybe that would stop the addition of balance to the next customer.</p>
<p>I don't think that is a go, tho.</p>

<p>What i'm trying to do: Instead of using the scanner class in the main, I'm using it in it's own method that method is called <code>personName()</code>.</p>
<p>The problem that I am facing: the problem am i facing is when I run the program I have to type the name twice, if I dont it throws me an exception.</p>
<p>the cause of the problem: I know what's causing the problem, I just dont know how to fix it. The problem arise when I call <code>personName()</code> twice in two different methods, but I need to call it twice so i can get the data from it. The first time i called it is in the <code>id()</code> method. I did this so i can get how many characters the name has. The second time i called it when it's in the <code>yourArrays()</code> method. I did this because I needed to store the name inside of an array. I called it twice by using the variable <code>String yourName = personName();</code> inside the <code>id()</code> method and I called it again using the variable <code>String name = personName();</code> inside the <code>yourArrays();</code> method.</p>
<p>what have I tried: I tried to close the scanner but it still just throws the exception since it's still getting called twice, and since it is closed there's no way to get the data anyway.</p>
<p>What answer am I looking for: The answer I want is how do I stop the system from asking the user to input the name twice, or is there a way to get the name the user inputted without calling the method?</p>

<p>The button part works, but the KeyEvent not.
And when I run this I keep getting these errors:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>Exception in thread &quot;AWT-EventQueue-1&quot; java.lang.NumberFormatException: empty String
</code></pre>
<p>But when I do this, it kinda works. I still get the same errors but it works. (By the way not optimal, because it only appends it to the text field every second key pressing.):</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  public void nfAantal_KeyPressed(KeyEvent evt) {
    if (nfAantal.getInt() &lt; 1 || nfAantal.getInt() &gt; 7) {
      taLijst.append(nfAantal.getText());
    } else {
      //some other code (not impotant for now)
      }
  }  
</code></pre>
<p>So if someone knows why this doesn't work or knows a better way to accomplish this. Then that would be very appreciated!</p>
<p>(By the way I use Java 1.8)</p>
<strong>Edit:</strong>
<p>I now have <code>(nfAantal.getText().length() &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (nfAantal.getInt() &lt; 1 || nfAantal.getInt() &gt; 7)</code> in the if statement and that got rid of the errors. (Thanks to @Joe)<br />
But that still doesn't solve my question on how to turn the background red on certain values.</p>
<strong>Aditional information about <code>JNumberField</code>:</strong>
<p>I think <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:jAKgs_ErC-gJ:www.javaeditor.org/wiki/jedownload/JNumberField.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a> has the code that makes up <code>JNumberField</code> and <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hoWjI0A-KEnwakZFNxzR0XiWxdeaanmp/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a> contains a download to the .jar file with in there the <code>JNumberField</code> Java file.</p>
<strong>Another edit:</strong>
<p>I think I found out for myself why it doesn't work with a <code>JNumberfield</code>; in the code it changes the background to white if its value is numeric so only if there is a way to get around this part of the code or change it (which I don't know how to do) my question can be answered for a <code>JNumberField</code>, if this isn't the case then I will use the <code>JFormattedTextField</code> instead.</p>
<p>This is the code that needs to be altered or circumvented:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>  protected void processKeyEvent(KeyEvent e) {
    super.processKeyEvent(e);
    if (isNumeric() || getText().equals(&quot;-&quot;) ||
        getText().equals(&quot;&quot;) || getText().equals(&quot;.&quot;))
      setBackground(Color.white);
    else
      setBackground(Color.red);

<p>We used to have a single java file that was 1000+ lines long and each application was having it as class inside, so when there was a change, each application had to edit the java file inside of it or simply fix one and copy to all. This is hard to implement as much as it is hard to maintain. Then we end-up with creating this as a separate application that is divided to smaller part, which is easy to maintain and also a core maybe a dependency to other application so we fix in one place and all other code applications are fixed too.</p>
<p>I've been thinking for a some great structure for this for a while want to use a builder patter for this as below</p>

<pre><code>someOtherClass.doSomething(theCore)
</code></pre>
<p>which is injecting the main object as a parameter but still <code>someOtherClass</code> needs to be initialized or even a static method which doesn't make me feel comfortable and right way to that.</p>
<p>Actually I do not care if initializing <code>TheCore</code> would bring me a super object that includes all other classes inside initialized and ready to be accessed after I initialized <code>TheCore</code>. All I want in this structure to have a maintainable separate app and methods avaiable if only the main object which is <code>TheCore</code> is this circumstances is initialized.</p>
<p>What is to right way to achive it? I see that Java does not allow extending multiple classes even it if does, I'm not sure it that is right way...</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

"66316433","1","66316742","","2021-02-22 13:15:54","","0","54","<p>I have created a game in Java where the user get to choose 1, 2 or 3 dices and wins if the sum equals to 12. The game continues until the user type in the charater q. For every other character, texts or numbers (except 1,2, 3) the game says unvalid value and prompts the user again to choose a dice or type q to quit.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the sum is &gt; 12 and the user has used all three dices, it counts as a loss.</li>
<li>When the sum = 12, it counts as a win.</li>
<li>When the user has won or used all 3 dices, a new round begin automatically and the user is now free to use all dices again.</li>
<li>The user can only use each dice once in each round, so the user cant for example choose dice no 1 three times in a row.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think that is where the problem lies. Sometimes when I run the program it doesnt act like its supposed to.
If I for example types 1 and then types a random character (for example h) it says ”unvalid value” and then that ”I already has chosen dice no 1”.</p>
<p>How do I fix it?</p>

<p>I'm not quiet sure how to explain what this code is supossed to do but I hope you get what I wanted it to do. It's supposed to take the value behinde index 7 of hash and replace it with the value behinde index &quot;var&quot; of ALPHABET.</p>

<p>For some reason that I can't fathom, <code>payOrder</code> doesn't work, and the order always comes back unpaid, while <code>deliverOrder</code> and <code>refundOrder</code> work fine. By the way, is there some way I can get it to immediately display the orders in their updated state, because for some reason when I refund an order or mark it delivered, I have to run <code>displayOrder</code> to see the updated order. Also, does anyone know what the pale green highlighting in NetBeans means? I keep seeing it, but can't seem to find any key on the web. TIA.</p>

<p>So much java code I've seen uses manual string split/join/concatenation, with the occasional <code>URLEncoder.encode()</code>/<code>URLDecoder.decode()</code>. And this leads to unsafe code.</p>
<p>I thought the two contenders were Spring's <code>UriComponentsBuilder</code> and apache's <code>URIBuilder</code>. But I don't see that either of these two allow me to extract a query parameter from a URL, which is such a common use-case.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do the Java equivalent of this Javascript:</p>
<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>let url = new URL(&quot;http://foobar/path&quot;)
url.searchParams.set(&quot;param1&quot;, &quot;a=b&quot;)

// See that it gets encoded properly as param1=a%3Db
console.log(url)
// prints: http://foobar/path?param1=a%3Db

// And decoded properly again as a=b
console.log(new URL(url.toString()).searchParams.get(&quot;param1&quot;))
// prints: &quot;a=b&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><code>UriComponentsBuilder</code> has a <code>build().getQueryParams().getFirst(&quot;param1&quot;)</code> method for it, but it doesn't decode the parameter, and <code>URIBuilder</code> requires me to search through a list of parameters myself - not the handiest API.</p>

<p>What I don't get is whether <code>&quot;Coordinator job with frequency [&quot; + freq + &quot;] minutes is faster than allowed maximum of 5 minutes (&quot;+ CONF_CHECK_MAX_FREQUENCY + &quot; is set to true)&quot;</code> log can be printed.</p>
<p>As long as I know, when <code>if (freq == 0 || (freq &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; unit == CoordinatorJob.Timeunit.MINUTE))</code> condition meets and the program throws IllegalArgumentException.
The thrown exception will be caught at <code>catch (NumberFormatException e)</code>, and handled in that block as <code>e</code>.</p>
<p>But that <code>e</code> is never used afterward.</p>
<p>So I wonder whether it's possible to print <code>Coordinator job with frequency ...</code> log.</p>
<p>For me, it doesn't seem to have a difference between the original code and just putting the catch block into <code>if (freq == 0 || (freq &lt; 5 &amp;&amp; unit == CoordinatorJob.Timeunit.MINUTE))</code> statement, as below:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>    private void validateCoordinatorJob() throws Exception {

out.println(&quot;    &quot;.repeat(Math.max(0, howDeep)) + actualString);

<p>but well if howDeep is for example 2100 then it is kinda expensive so if I process this code with random howDeep values and random string it is a lot of data to write.</p>
<p>How can I firstly generate this spaces in good time secondly how to write data in fast way?</p>

<p>By default, Java applications are single thread application. We are going for the concept called multithreading to share the work. Means, instead of doing the work with one thread (Main thread) if we create the thread, then it will simplifies the work. I understood this thing theoretically. My doubt arises when I start coding.
In the above program I have created 3 threads. If 3 threads are working on the same logic (iteration and printing the values by using for loop) why it is giving 3 separate output instead of giving one set of values from 0 to 4?</p>

<p>One could say: a method that does roughly that what forEach does:

<p>I need to develop this method without changing anything in the following code as possible and <strong>only with Java 7</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>System.out.println(Arrays.toString(map(map, new BiConsumer&lt;String,Integer&gt;(){

<p>This is the code that I am using for a solve method for a java project for my class in which I am coding a hangman game. I am trying to add a feature that asks the user if they would like to try to solve the word and then checks to see if they got that guess correct. Right now what is happening is that no matter what the user puts in, even if it is &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, the program thinks that it is an invalid input and asks the question again, putting the code into an infinite loop. I'm not quite sure how to fix this and I'm not sure what I am doing wrong. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Now, what exactly is the meaning in the following piece of code in this context?</p>
<pre><code>class C {

  }

</code></pre>
<p>The code compiles, but I wonder why the compile is fine with using <code>A&lt;?&gt;</code>? I would expect the compiler to complain that <code>A</code> must be used in the same way either on the attribute level (<code>a1</code>) or on the class level (<code>a2</code>):</p>
<pre><code>class C&lt;T extends B&gt; {
   A&lt;? extends B&gt; a1;
   A&lt;? extends B&gt; getA1() {

  A&lt;T&gt; a2;

<p>So my guess is that <code>A&lt;?&gt;</code> is only syntactic sugar, but the meaning is equal to <code>A&lt;? extends B&gt;</code>? However, many answers on stack overflow regarding the notation <code>Something&lt;?&gt;</code> means <code>Something&lt;? extends Object&gt;</code> which then would mean that all those answers are wrong?</p>
<p>But it is not possible to assign a <code>A&lt;?&gt;</code> typed variable to one of type <code>A&lt;? extends B&gt;</code>, which makes clear that the compiler is unaware of the fact that it is impossible to create an <code>A&lt;X&gt;</code> where <code>X</code> is not a subclass of <code>B</code>.</p>
<p>Theoretical, the <code>A&lt;?&gt;</code> just means unknown type argument, but the compiler should still know that the type argument must be a subclass of B because of the type parameter definition of A. But it seems that the compiler does not take into account this? Why?</p>

<p>These two classes definitely have some boilerplate code. If multiple inheritance were a reality, I'd organize two mixins here: IdMixin and ArchivedMixin. Therefore classes would contain no bodies at all. But in Java it is not possible.</p>

Basically my problem concerns moving a pawn following several rules (later specified). I have created this solution (it works) to <strong>get the moves(only the ones that are possible) of the pawn and to iterate over them</strong>  to create news states of the problem and <em><strong>I wanted to know if there is a more efficient way to solve this.</strong></em> Basically, the roles of the movements are:</p>
<ol>
<li>The pawn can move in the 8 possibles directions(up, down, left, right, diagonals).</li>
<li>The pawn can only move 1 step each move.</li>
<li>The pawn can not move to a tile if the other pawn is there, or if the tile is markdown.</li>
<li>After each move the player can markdown a tile of the board ( one which does not have a pawn and one which is not markdown already).</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my solution:</p>
<p><strong>Getting the possible moves</strong></p>
<pre><code>    public List&lt;Integer&gt; moves(int f, int c) {
    List&lt;Integer&gt; moves= new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();
    int nuevaX,nuevaY;
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++){
        for(int j = 0; j &lt; 3; j++){
            if (!(i == 1 &amp;&amp; j == 1)) {
                nuevaX = f + (i - 1);
                nuevaY = c + (j - 1);
                if (disponible(nuevaX,nuevaY) &amp;&amp; !ocupada(nuevaX, nuevaY)) {
                    moves.add(nuevaX);
                    moves.add(nuevaY);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return moves;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Iterating</strong></p>
<pre><code>List&lt;Integer&gt; moves = moves(f, c);
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; moves.size(); i+=2) { 
        x = moves.get(i);
        y = moves.get(i+1);

<p>Right now, it seems to me that all of the files in the generated source folder are getting deleted every time I run the build task for my gradle project. This means that any code I write in the annotation processor to check for the existence of a given generated source file will always return a negative result, even if the generated source file existed prior to running the build task.  Is there any way to prevent the generated source folder from getting scrubbed every time you rerun javac with an annotation processor? Or is there a better way to achieve what I am trying to accomplish?</p>

Do you have any suggestions how I can set up the construct based on the current setup.</p>
<p>There are five classes interacting with each other:</p>
<p>First class is the Overview class with the main methode. She should create an instance of my control class and execute the methode control.displayArtist(salary, name):</p>

<p>The seccond class is the class Control. The class Control creates an instance of the class Language and consists of the methode displayArtist(int salary, String name). This method is callded directly in the main methode of the Overview Class:</p>

}

public void displayArtist(int salary, String name) {

}

}

<p>The Language class has all the println statements and is creating an instance of the Artist, for the methode displayArtistAndSalary(String name, int salary) to handle the String name and the int salary coming from the Artist class:</p>
<pre><code>public class Language {
    
    private Artist artist;
    
    public Language () {
    
    artist = new Artist();
        
    }
public void specifyArtist() {
    System.out.println(&quot;Who is the artist? &quot;);
}

public void specifyArtistSalary() {
    System.out.println(&quot;How much does the artist earn? &quot;);
}

    
public void displayArtistAndSalary(String name, int salary) {
    System.out.println(&quot;Artist: &quot; + artist.getName(name));
    System.out.println(&quot;Salary: &quot; + artist.getSalary(salary));

}

}
</code></pre>
<p>Based on the input from the InputReader class:</p>
<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;

public class InputReader {

    Scanner sc;
    private Language language;

    
public InputReader () {
    sc = new Scanner(System.in);

}

public void addArtist(String name) {
    language.specifyArtist();

}

public void addArtistSalary (int salary) {
    language.specifyArtistSalary();
     salary = sc.nextInt();
         
}

    
}

<p>the artist class returns the name and the salary in the methodes getName (String name) and getSalary(int salary):</p>

<p>to check whether or not nextMove() had changed the state of the object, but I think when state was updated, bstate was updated too because after the method call, bstate was the same as astate where it wasn't before.</p>
<p>So I'm wondering if as my methods update state, they implicitly update bstate too and if so, how do I prevent this from happening?</p>

<li>Multiple int[] or long[] (or more summable primitive types data) will be given.</li>

<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: Index 0 out of bounds for length 0
</code></pre>
<p>Since I am totally new to this, I am not sure where I am doing wrong. I can get the program to scan the input text file normally using an object from the scanner class but when I try and pass it as an argument, I get the above error. How do I fix this error? The program below is not the full program but big enough to compile and show the error I am getting. I am using an online IDE atm and I have a 'file.txt' that contains integer values I want. I believe the error's got something to do with the args statement. Can anyone help me fix this please?</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class NormalizedTransfer

  protected final List&lt; Normalized &gt; normalizedList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();

<em>Only, when I analyse a the next patient in a document, and instantiate a new <code>PatientNormalizer</code>, the <code>normalizedList</code> of <code>NormalizedTransfer</code> is a different list that the one for a bundle, than the other one for an observation, etc.</em></p>
<p>Of course it is; I know this. I'm probably looking for a &quot;pattern&quot; to implement.</p>
<p>Also, all of this code will be executed by myriad other threads handling each a separate medical document. So, what I'm asking for is a single (simple) database (<code>ArrayList</code>) bookkeeping a list of normalizations that I'm recording for a whole document no matter what the type and how many resources (patients, observations, accounts, etc.) are encountered. And it can't have anything to do with whatever's being found in other documents.</p>

But I still want to know beside using my idea, are there any other way (more efficiency). Even if your idea are the very same with my idea but you have something upgrade.

<p>I have those 2 Strings to check the contents, but even just reading the ISO file, it gives question marks where umlauts are (?) and converting that to UTF_8 gives strange characters like 1/2 and so on.</p>

<pre><code>byte[] bytesInIso = ByteStreams.toByteArray(inputWithNamespace);

byte[] bytesInUtf = new String(bytesInIso, ISO_8859_1).getBytes(UTF_8);
String contentInUtf = new String(bytesInUtf);

<p>Verifying contentInIso prints question marks instead of the umlauts and by checking contentInIso instead of umlauts, it has characters like &quot;ï¿½&quot;.</p>
<pre><code>@Override
    public List&lt;Usage&gt; convert(InputStream input) {
        try {

            String contentInUtf = new String(bytesInUtf);

            ORDR order = xmlUnmarshaller.unmarshall(inputWithNamespace, ORDR.class);

<p>This method convert it's called by another one called processUsageFile:</p>

            log.info(&quot;Usage file {} imported successfully. Moving to archive directory&quot;, usageFile.getName());
</code></pre>
<p>If i take the code I have written under the UPDATE statement and put it immediately after the try, the first contentInIso has question marks but the contentInUtf has the umlauts. Then, by going into the convert, jabx throws an exception that the file has a premature end of line.</p>

I have to find out If an athlete went beyond 250 points in a single task. Firstly, I made an integer which counts the number of times the Array has been look at, If the number can be divided by 5 it means the next number is going to be the next row and thus a new athlete, next I created another loop to check all the previous numbers and if any of them goes beyond 250, I add one number to the total + break the cycle.

<blockquote>
<p>public boolean equals(Object obj) Indicates whether some other object
is &quot;equal to&quot; this one. The equals method implements an equivalence
relation on non-null object references:</p>
<p>It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x)
should return true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x)
returns true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x,
y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true,
then x.equals(z) should return true.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is consistent: for any
non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y)
consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no
information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified. For
any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating
possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null
reference values x and y, this method returns true if and only if x
and y refer to the same object (x == y has the value true).</p>
<p>Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method
whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general
contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must
have equal hash codes.</p>
<p>Parameters: obj - the reference object with which to compare. Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj argument; false otherwise.

You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function fascinating() which takes the integer n parameters and returns boolean denoting the answer.</p>
<p>Expected Time Complexity: O(1)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)</p>
<p>Constraints:
100 &lt;= N &lt;= 107</p>
<p>i have to complete the following fascinating function my code is returning error.</p>
<pre><code>class Solution {
boolean fascinating(String q) {
    // code here
    int sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i&lt;q.length(); i++){
        sum = sum + Integer.parseInt(Character.toString(q.charAt(i)));
    }
    if(sum == 45){
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
}
</code></pre>
<p>When i saw the solution code i am not able to understand how it is doing the things.</p>
<pre><code>class Solution {
boolean fascinating(String q) {
    int A[] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,
               0, 0, 0, 0}; // to store count of every digit from '0' to '9'
    int i, flag = 0;
    char ch;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; q.length(); i++) {
        ch = q.charAt(i);
        A[ch - 48]++;
    }

    for (i = 1; i &lt; 10; i++) {
        // checking if every digit from '1' to '9' are present exactly once
        // or not
        if (A[i] != 1) {
            flag = 1; // flag is set to 1 if frequency is not 1

<p>The input is a string, the expected output is an int array.</p>
<p>For examples:</p>
<p>(1) input: a string, such as &quot;1234&quot;;</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; output: int array: {1,2,3,4}
</code></pre>
<p>(2) input: &quot;12s4&quot;</p>
<pre><code>=&gt; output: throw out an Exception.
</code></pre>
<p>2.My code:
I'm converting the input string to an int array as the following:</p>
<pre><code>int[] StringToArray(String strInput) {

    int[] nArray = new int[strInput.length()];
    for(int i=0; i&lt;strInput.length(); i++) {
        nArray[i] = Character.digit(strInput.charAt(i), 10);
    }

    return nArray;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But when the input is a character, the output can still be converted to an integer.
For example, &quot;12s4&quot; is converted to be [1,2,-1,4].</p>
<p>3.Question:</p>
<p>How can it throw out an Exception if there is a character such as 's' in the input string？</p>

<p>The spec mention package javax.xml.stream so I figured all the API’s in that package would be explicitly defined in the specification.</p>
<p>For example, In the spec. I found the class javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory but it only mentions one of it’s methods newInstance(), nothing about the other 14 methods the class has.</p>
<p>Other interfaces and Errors like FactoryConfigurationError and EventFilter from the javax.xml.stream package are not even mentioned.</p>

But when i tried to create a project from my mind, some errors occured in my brain. Since i know how to create websites and website menus etc., i couldnt figure out how can I create a functional menu without nested switch statements in java.(maybe in passed semester we didnt study that kind of things.)</p>
<p>The problem which I couldnt solve is, if I want to create menu, then every single menu element have multiple elements inside, and all of them depends on user's input for being functional, there will be 100 different switch case operation for me. So I wanted to ask here, if im thinking in wrong way, or is there a better solution for that.</p>
<p>Shortly, I want to create a java program with tons of user input choices and nested switch statements. And want to learn if nested switch statements are the only solutions.</p>
<p>In the following pseudo-code, im writing a small part of my idea which can be extended a lot more. And also I can take experiences from experienced developers about that kind of projects. I found myself while im doing too many self minded projects and most of them are not really a real life problems. But I feel like im learning a lot even with that kind of sillies.</p>

personList.add(new Person(&quot;Dave&quot;, 21, &quot;Rotterdam&quot;, &quot;Langedijk&quot;));

<p>In this example, I use index 0. I want something like this:</p>
<pre><code>personList.get(0).itemToGet;

<p>I know this is not going to work, but I hope you get the idea. I want to get the element that is inside the <code>itemToGet</code> String.</p>

<p>Now, in a project I'm working on, I'm using the following code to get a random value of an enum (which I need when a config-file does not specify one). For example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>if (this.direction == null) {
    this.direction = Direction.values()[new Random().nextInt(Direction.values().length()]);

<p>This works fine, but I'm coming to a point where lots of duplication for this code is showing up:</p>

if (this.season == null) {

}
if (this.weekDay == null) {
    this.weekDay = WeekDay .values()[new Random().nextInt(WeekDay .values().length()]);
}
[...]
</code></pre>
<p>What I'm now looking for, is to make a utility class/method, which is capable of doing this for any enum, eliminating the code duplication. The end result should look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>if (this.season == null) {
    this.season = EnumUtil.getRandomValue(Season.class);
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are a couple of things I have tried, but I never got past the point where my IDE (IntelliJ Community) would stop highlighting everything in deep red warnings. Something like:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>public static &lt;clazz&gt; clazz getRandomValue(@NotNull Class&lt;Enum&lt;?&gt;&gt; e) {

<p>My question is why does the last <code>else if</code> condition need to post-increment and post-decrement <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to index a letter, if that is already happening in the two conditions above?</p>
<p>I noticed that it causes an infinite loop without it. But since the instructions are in a for loop and if the condition evaluated as false <code>(c[i++]==c[j--])</code> then nothing would happen. Then <code>i</code> would increment at the start of the for-loop again, thus an infinite loop should be impossible. That is what I understand, so far.</p>

<p>How force developers to use parameterized constructor only if value differs from default:
not calling new Student(&quot;Mike&quot;) but use for this new Student()?</p>
<p>The reason: we have constructor with 5 parameters. In most cases parameters are the same. But there are about 5%-10% cases when they differ.
 So in order to avoid duplications, I would like to use such approach.
I know it maybe better to use smth like Builder pattern here. But I don't like it verbosity.</p>

<p>I don't understand why the value of b is -1. The value of b starts from 5 (after while loop it's value is 4) and then ends at 1 ( after the while loop it is 0) and then the iteration from 5 to 1 is 5.If how I think is right, why is the value of b is -1 after looping. Thank you.</p>

            }
        }
        return Collections.emptyList();
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Specifically, the line <code>return (Collection&lt;clazz&gt;) collection;</code> is producing the warning:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Unchecked cast: 'java.util.Collection&lt;capture&lt;?&gt;&gt;' to 'java.util.Collection&lt;clazz&gt;'</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Honesty where appropriate: i improvised this method out of neccessity about one year ago, shortly after i started learning to code. Unfortunately, even now, i still do not understand what exactly the <code>&lt;clazz&gt;</code> stuff i put there is doing, why it works and how it works.</p>
<p>In that sense: i'm looking to understand - not to be spoonfed the solution to remove the warning message, of course. (And i totally didn't use <code>@SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)</code> prior to this post.)</p>
<p><strong>/edit:</strong></p>
<p>After reading the replies so far, i am in the ball park of understand why this warning is produced.</p>
<p>Now, for a theoretical workaround that <em>should</em> solve the problem:</p>
<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>    public final @NotNull &lt;T&gt; Collection&lt;T&gt; getCollection(@NotNull String key, @NotNull Class&lt;T&gt; dataType) {
        Object object = this.data.get(key);
        Collection&lt;T&gt; r = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
        if (object instanceof Collection) {
            Collection&lt;?&gt; collection = (Collection&lt;?&gt;) object;
            for (Object o : collection) {
                if (o.getClass().equals(dataType)) {
                    r.add((T) o);
                }
            }
        }
        return r;
    }
</code></pre>
<p>But now the line <code>r.add((T) o);</code> is producing the same warning. There must be a better condition other than <code>o.getClass().equals(dataType)</code> that will make the IDE understand. (IntelliJ Community Edition, by the way)</p>

<p>Is there another way to do this which requires lesser time for execution? The sample input I used here is just for testing purpose, the input can be up to 99 integers, and the input will not always be sorted. Both of these programs work well in IDE but they fail multiple test cases when I submit the code.<br />
Here is the actual problem statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write a function called <code>solution(data, n)</code> that takes in a list of less than 100 integers and a number <code>n</code>, and returns that same list but with all of the numbers that occur more than <code>n</code> times removed entirely. The returned list should retain the same ordering as the original list. For instance, if data was [5, 10, 15, 10, 7] and n was 1, solution(data, n) would return the list [5, 15, 7] because 10 occurs twice, and thus was removed from the list entirely.</p>
<p>Constraints: Java 8, limited execution time, no wildcard imports</p>

I have never used Java before but this seemed like such a good course, I'm trying to muddle through rather than switching to a 'worse' course in a language I know. I have also found a thread specifically on this issue <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34716370/java-error-exception-in-thread-main-java-lang-noclassdeffounderror"">here</a> and a Reddit question <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjava/comments/guzyaw/from_could_not_find_or_load_main_class_to/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, which were equally as useless as the other questions which had this problem, but not with the Princeton's <code>algs4.jar</code> file.</p>
<p>This is my code, I haven't bothered to finish it but it should run. Before anybody asks, I've commented out everything except the first <code>if (StdIn.isEmpty())</code> check and it still gives me all the same compiler/interpreter errors, so this is nothing to do with it being half-finished - <code>StdIn.isEmpty()</code> and <code>StdIn.readString()</code> are supposed to be provided by <code>algs4.jar</code>:</p>
<pre><code>import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdIn;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdOut;
import edu.princeton.cs.algs4.StdRandom;

class RandomWord
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        if (StdIn.isEmpty())
        {
            System.out.println(&quot;Nothing to read.&quot;);
            return;
        }

        String curr_selected_word;
        double curr_probability = 0.0;
        int i = 0;

        while (!StdIn.isEmpty())
        {
            String current_string = StdIn.readString();
            System.out.println(&quot;&gt; &quot; + current_string);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Following the advice of previous threads, I compile like this:</p>
<pre><code>javac -cp &quot;./algs4.jar&quot; RandomWord.java
</code></pre>
<p>Which works fine. Running <code>java RandomWord</code>, I get this large messy error:</p>
<pre><code>Exception in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: edu/princeton/cs/algs4/StdIn

        at java.base/java.lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.java:521)
        ... 1 more
</code></pre>
<p>The accepted answer on the other question was to reference the <code>.jar</code> file explicitly, like this:</p>
<pre><code>java -cp &quot;C:\Coursera\Algorithms\Part 1\Java Solutions\HelloWorld;C:\Coursera\Algorithms\Part 1\Java Solutions\algs4.jar&quot; RandomWord
</code></pre>
<p>Which gives me the exact same error. There is also a comment on the Reddit thread that uses the <code>-classpath</code> instead of <code>-cp</code> flag, which at least gives a different but stranger error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;java -classpath ./algs4.jar RandomWord
Error: Could not find or load main class RandomWord
Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: RandomWord
</code></pre>
<p>Putting quotes around the <code>.jar</code> filepath, or providing the absolute filepath, all produce the same error.
I Googled this and predictably it is caused by not having a <code>main</code> entry-point, but... see code above?</p>
<p>Lastly, the installer for the Coursera course apparently installs some <em>Bash</em> commands (<a href=""https://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/hello/specification.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">see here</a>) called <code>javac-algs4</code> and <code>java-algs4</code> which is supposed to sort out all this classpath nonsense for me. So I crack open <em>Bash</em>, and:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;javac-algs4 RandomWord.java
'javac-algs4' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</code></pre>
<p>I have restarted since running the installer. I would add these to my <code>PATH</code> manually, but I don't even know where they are; the <code>C:\Program Files\LIFT-CS</code> folder that their installer installs into only contains a pissing <em>uninstaller</em>. So I'm absolutely losing my rag and at my wits' end after spending over 7 hours just trying to <em>start</em> this course, not even getting stuck on the problems or the content. When will content creators learn we don't want your in-house IDE with no dark mode and libraries that do nothing but rename every function to camel-case?</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone has encountered this or knows what I could do to fix it, help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>The program contains two more classes: <code>IndexEntry</code> which represents one index entry, and the <code>DocumentIndex</code> class which represents the entire index for a document: the list of all its index entries. The index entries should always be arranged in alphabetical order. So the implementation for these two classes are shown below</p>

<pre><code>project
- exports
- src
  - main
    - java
      - Main
- file1
- file2 
</code></pre>
<p>One of the <code>args</code> in <code>main</code> method is the name of one of those 2 files, that I then access.</p>
<p>When I configure my run in <strong>IDE</strong> it works like a charm - the directory I get is <code>C:\Users\**\**\**\project</code> and it is able to read and write to the file.</p>
<p>But when I compile it in <strong>cmd</strong> <code>javac Main.java</code> and then run it, I get <code>C:\Users\**\**\**\project\src\main\java</code> and because of that, I am unable to access the file without having to modify the <em>path</em>.</p>
<p>My question is, is there like a golden way, that would work for both these cases, without me having to alter the returned path?</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>For clear understanding, I know what <code>System.getProperty(&quot;user.dir&quot;)</code> returns, but my question was, if it is possible to get the same result somehow with using <code>Path</code> or if I have to get the path and edit it, so that it will end in <em>project directory</em>?</p>
<p><strong>in IDE</strong> I get: <code>C:\Users\petri\Desktop\CZM\bicycle-statistics</code></p>
<p><strong>in cmd</strong>: <code>C:\Users\petri\Desktop\CZM\bicycle-statistics\src\main\java</code></p>
<p>I want to get the same path in cmd, that I got in IDE.</p>
<p>I tried using <code>Paths.get(&quot;&quot;).toAbsolutePath()</code>, but it is the same thing.</p>
<p>So, what I did is this:</p>
<pre><code>Path path = Paths.get(&quot;&quot;).toAbsolutePath();
while (!path.endsWith(&quot;project&quot;)) {
    path = path.getParent();
}
</code></pre>
<p>And it works, but I am trying to ask, if there is some more elegant way, because I will have to defend my solution in front of my supervisor.</p>

One of the other options is to delete a cone. The user is prompted to enter a label (name of the cone) and then the <code>deleteCone</code> method from my <code>ConeList</code> is called. For some reason, I keep getting an issue where that cone is not being found in the <code>ArrayList</code>.
